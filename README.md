## Some observations on student work: HTML

The page looks good in the browser, except for the white spacing. A few comments about the html code:

Do not use the center tag in html. Center an element with CSS. 

Always use em instead of i tag. 
Always use strong instead of b tag.

Do not use inline style.

The use of ul tag in blockquote is an incorrect use of the ul tg. 

No need to use the figure tag in this assignment. 

Use the semantic section tag instead of div. 

## Some observations on student work: CSS

Style body tag at the top of the CSS so that everything in the body styling cascades down to the other elements. 

Top section is overly complex. Styling the body would have helped. 

No need for span in the h1. Just style the h1 in CSS. 
No need for the strong tag in the h1. Just style the h1 in the css. 

Use rem instead of px. 

No need to use @font-face. Apply the font-family to an element. 

No need for position: relative on the blockquote. 

No need for a span to style italics in the css. Just use the em tag in html.
